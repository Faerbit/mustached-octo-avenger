Top Down Space Shooter in the making

This is a educational project of mine to learn something about game development.

Currently this isn't playable. It is rather an attempt to learn C++/OpenGL.

Should be compatible with Windows/Mac OS X/Linux. Currently only tested on Linux.

##Building

Dependencies: OpenGL, GLEW, SDL2

###Building on Linux

Clone this repository and then do the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The resulting binary will be in build/src
